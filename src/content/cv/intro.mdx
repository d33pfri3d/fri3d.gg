As a Full-stack developer with a decade of experience, I have been privileged to work on a variety of projects that have pushed the boundaries of what technology can achieve. From crafting Native Mobile and Desktop applications to designing Full Stack Web Development projects, my expertise in **JavaScript**/**Typescript** and **Ruby** has been instrumental in bringing these innovative ideas to life.

As a passionate advocate for cutting-edge frameworks, I have honed my skills in React and React Native, using various state management libraries such as Redux, Jotai and Zustand along with using Jest with Detox / Appium to conduct unit testing and E2E automated testing.

Occasionally, I have had the pleasure of exploring more experimental technologies such as WebGL (three.js) to create interactive experiences that captivate audiences. I worked with Walt Disney to create a 360Â° video based game with Mickey Mouse and worked with Santander and Pernod Ricard to build a WebXR campaign piece.

As the popularity of Web3 and dApps continue to soar, I have taken on exciting opportunities to work with startups that are leading the charge. This includes leveraging the power of the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/index.html) and [Solana](https://solana.com/) to create NFT platforms, and collaborating with [moonpay.com](http://moonpay.com/) to develop a multi-chain custodial wallet solution for currency and NFTs.

My passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems drives me to constantly push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of technology.
