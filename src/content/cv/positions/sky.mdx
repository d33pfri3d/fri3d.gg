I worked on Sky's innovative MySkyApp project, focusing on ensuring precise acceptance criteria for technical tasks and advising on the best technical strategies. I also mentor junior developers, helping them with their tasks, fostering problem-solving, improving developer experience, and promoting knowledge sharing to streamline our project workflow. My commitment to teamwork and inclusion significantly benefits the team.
