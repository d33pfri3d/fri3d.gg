At present, I am collaborating with Sky on their groundbreaking MySkyApp initiative. My chief responsibility involves working closely with the team to ensure the accurate collection of acceptance criteria for technical tasks while simultaneously offering valuable input regarding the most optimal Technical approach.

In addition to this, I am also serving as a mentor to several Junior developers, providing guidance and support as they navigate their current assignments. I actively engage with them to brainstorm solutions to problems, explore different strategies to enhance the DX (Developer Experience), and encourage knowledge sharing to improve the overall workflow of the project. My passion for creating a collaborative and inclusive work environment makes me an invaluable asset to the team.
