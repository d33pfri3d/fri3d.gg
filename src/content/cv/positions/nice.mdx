At Nice I helped build the web team with the CTO and work on a wide array of products including the i100 for the Independent newspaper, More 4 and various MVPs for start ups.

I was also training Junior developers as needed.

As a Tech lead I was a key decision maker in the technology that was used on a particular project, ran scrum teams on a number of projects and prioritised workloads for both the web and mobile team.
