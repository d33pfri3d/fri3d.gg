I started at Sapient as a Junior developer and worked myself up to Senior over 3 years. I worked on redevelopment projects for clients such as HSBC, John Lewis and Footlocker as well as taking the lead on
projects for BT, Singapore Airlines and EE launch project.

I also took on training for many of the junior developers to help them brush up on any skills that they might want to, both engineering and soft skills.
