I helped develop Walmart's staff app for daily management tasks like messaging, shift swaps, and scheduling. My role was in a small team focused on the scheduling features. I wrote end-to-end tests using a custom framework based on Appium for testing on both real and simulated devices, and I also wrote unit tests in Jest.
