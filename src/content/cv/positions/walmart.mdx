I worked with Walmart on their internal staff application to assist staff in managing their day-to-day work, including communications with other stores, shift-swapping and general work scheduling.

I worked in a small team managing the scheduling side of the application, including writing E2E tests with an internally developed framework ( built on-top of Appium ) to run tests on physical devices and simulated devices in Sauce Labs and unit tests written in Jest.
