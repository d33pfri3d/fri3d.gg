I worked with Moonpay to build their mobile wallet for Crypto and NFTs. It was a greenfield project in which I set up the base application (TypeScript, RTL, Context) and CI set up using CircleCI → Fastlane → Microsoft AppCenter, Testflight and Play Store as well as working on the API side using Next/Nest JS.

Written using a HATEOAS design, test-driven development and strict typescript standards.

Working closely with every department within Moonpay, from Security through to Legal to deliver a fully featured non-custodial & Custodial experience for first-time NFT customers.
