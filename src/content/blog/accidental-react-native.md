In 2015 I was knee deep in Ember. Boy, did I love that god-damn framework so hard. So hard in fact, I can't even remember why. Maybe it was because I was a big Yehuda fan as
I used to refer to myself as a Ruby developer (despite writing JavaScript for the majority of my work), because I just wanted to be cool. Cool like Ruby developers who loved Rails.
Maybe it was because even in 2015 it was cool to hate on Angular.

I worked for this little agency in London, bulding web apps and such using pretty much whatever we wanted to use at the time. It was glorious. We had the autonomy to pick whatever we wanted. Backbone, Angular, Knockout, Node, Ember. Each project could be different, so long as we were able to meet to clients needs, we had free choice. Hell, someone even let me build an agencies website using https://grabaperch.com/ once.

In-house we had a mobile dev team, the agency had primarily started as a app-shop building apps with Obj-C and Java. They would work on anything mobile related. With free access to the codes repository I had taken a look around and quickly backed out. I had no idea what the hell was happening in those files most of the time.

In the early 2010s I fooled around with Phonegap and was a huge advocate for it in the place I worked at the time. Phone apps were all the rage as soon as Apple annouced the app store in 2008 and Phonegap was one of the few ways to be a Javascript developer and deliver a 'native' app experience - sometimes they were called Hybrid apps. For another project I got to try Titanium, but wasn't too impressed by the whole thing at the time - i dont remember what specifically, but Im not currently nor have I ever considered muself a Titanium developer. There was of course the whole jQuery Mobile stuff kicking around for Web developers who now needed to consider various screen sizes for their web sites and apps all this was around the time 'progrssive web apps' movement was kicking off.

Then along came Facebook. Not satisfied with the rukas they started the web dev world they decided to take on mobile development.
